# 🕵️‍♂️ "No Logo" = "Old Code" = "Login Broken"

You said the **Eye Logo is not visible**.
This is the KEY. If you don't see the Eye Logo, **you are using the old website**.
The old website has the **Deleted Client ID**. That's why login fails.

## 🛠️ Step 1: Force Vercel to Update
Sometimes Vercel gets stuck or you are looking at an old link.

1.  Go to **[Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)**.
2.  Click your project (**visual-ai**).
3.  Click the **Deployments** tab (top menu).
4.  Look at the **Top Item** in the list.
    *   **Status**: Does it say **Ready** (Green) or **Error** (Red)?
    *   **Time**: Was it created "Just now" or "20 minutes ago"?
5.  **Click the "Visit" button** next to that TOP deployment.
    *   This opens the *guaranteed* newest version.

## 🛠️ Step 2: Google "Back to Testing"
You said it shows **"Back to testing"**.
*   **THIS IS GOOD!** ✅
*   It means your app is currently **PUBLISHED** (Live).
*   **STOP.** Do not click "Back to testing". Leave it alone. You are in the correct mode.

## 🚀 Summary
1.  Go to Vercel Deployments.
2.  Open the latest "Ready" deployment.
3.  If you see the **Eye Logo**, the Login WILL work.
