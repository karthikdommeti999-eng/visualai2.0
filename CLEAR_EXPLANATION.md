# 🧊 Why is the Logo Missing? (Simple Explanation)

Imagine you printed a flyer yesterday. Today, you changed the design on your computer.
**The flyer in your hand does not change.** You need to print a NEW flyer.

**Websites are the same.**
*   **Old Website** (In your browser) = Has the "Deleted ID" error.
*   **New Website** (In Vercel) = Has the "New ID" (Fixed) + "Eye Logo".

Since you **don't see the Eye Logo**, you are looking at the **Old Website**. That is why login fails.

# 🚀 How to get the "New Flyer" (New Website)

Follow these 3 simple steps to find the working version:

## 1. Go to Vercel
Click this link: **[https://vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)**

## 2. Check the "Status"
Click on your project (**visual-ai**). Look at the top of the list.
*   **GREEN (Ready)?** -> Good. The new site is built.
*   **RED (Error)?** -> Bad. The build failed. (If Red, tell me!).

## 3. Click "Visit"
Do not just type the URL. **Click the "Visit" button** on the Vercel dashboard.
*   This forces your browser to open the **New Version**.

**Check:**
*   **Do you see the Eye Logo?**
    *   **YES**: Great! Login will work.
    *   **NO**: Using your mouse, hold `SHIFT` and click the Refresh button ⟳.
